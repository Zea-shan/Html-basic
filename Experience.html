    <p>I have gained valuable experience through various internships and freelance projects. These opportunities have allowed me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios and work collaboratively with teams.</p>
    <p>During my internships, I have worked on web development projects, where I contributed to both front-end and back-end development. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React and Node.js. Additionally, I have worked with databases like MySQL and MongoDB.</p>
    <p>In my freelance projects, I have had the chance to interact directly with clients, understand their requirements, and deliver customized solutions. This has helped me improve my communication skills and ability to manage projects effectively.</p>
    <p>Overall, my experience has strengthened my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork. I am eager to continue building on this experience and take on new challenges in the field of web development.</p>
